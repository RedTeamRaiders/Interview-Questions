## 📌 Q22: Compare reasoning vs. non-reasoning LLMs for RAG systems.

### ✅ Answer

Reasoning LLMs such as GPT-4o1 and DeepSeek R1 are better generators in RAG systems because they have advanced "test-time compute" and chain-of-thought features. These unique abilities allow them to analyze the retrieved information more effectively and do multi-step reasoning to come up with better answers.  

But non-reasoning LLMs are still cheaper and faster, which makes them a good choice for many applications. In the end, the choice between reasoning and non-reasoning models depends on the query complexity.  

## 📌 Q23: What happens with a weak generator LLM in a RAG system?

### ✅ Answer

A weak generator LLM may find it difficult to understand the retrieved context, which could lead to answers that are incomplete or hallucinated. This makes the whole RAG system less useful because the final answers lack coherence and factual correctness, even though the context that was retrieved is good.

So, in a RAG setup, a strong generator LLM is necessary to convert retrieved knowledge into reliable, contextually relevant outputs.

## 📌 Q24: How do you handle ambiguous or vague user queries in RAG systems?

### ✅ Answer

Issues with ambiguous or vague user queries in RAG systems include retrieval of irrelevant information, incomplete answers, and increased risk of hallucination due to the lack of specificity. 

The most common strategy to handle ambiguous or vague user queries is query rewriting.  Query rewriting transforms unclear queries into precise and focused queries, thereby enhancing retrieval quality and leading to more accurate, grounded responses.
