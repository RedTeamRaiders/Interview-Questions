## 📌 Q34: What are some common chunking methods used in RAG?

### ✅ Answer

Common chunking methods used in RAG are fixed-size chunking, recursive chunking, semantic chunking, and agentic chunking. 

- Fixed-size chunking divides text into uniform segments based on a predefined token or character length, often incorporating overlap to maintain context. 

- Recursive chunking iteratively splits text using natural separators like paragraphs or sentences to preserve logical boundaries. Semantic chunking groups text based on semantic similarity using embeddings, creating coherent, meaning-based chunks. 

- Agentic chunking leverages AI agents to dynamically segment text into task-oriented, semantically coherent chunks, often with metadata to enhance retrieval relevance.


## 📌 Q35: What are the criteria to choose a specific chunking method in RAG?

### ✅ Answer

The criteria for choosing a specific chunking method in RAG include the nature and structure of the source documents, capabilities of the embedding model, and the specific task or application needs.  

For structured or well-formatted data, semantic or agentic chunking ensures logical boundaries and context preservation. The chunk size must balance between being large enough to capture meaningful context and small enough to fit within model constraints for efficient processing. 

Task specificity matters since complex tasks may require semantic or agentic chunking for better context and relevance, while simpler cases can use fixed-size chunking. 

Ultimately, the chunking method should balance retrieval relevance, context completeness, and computational efficiency.

## 📌 Q36: Explain the pros and cons of semantic chunking.

### ✅ Answer

Semantic chunking groups text based on meaning, creating coherent chunks that enhance retrieval relevance and context preservation. 

Pros: It aligns chunks with natural topic shifts, improving the quality of retrieved content for complex queries, and reduces information loss across boundaries. 

Cons: It is computationally intensive, requiring embedding models. Additionally, it may struggle with highly complex or poorly structured documents where semantic boundaries are unclear.
