## 📌 Q31: What are the different chunk enhancement techniques in RAG?

### ✅ Answer

The different chunk enhancement techniques in RAG are HyPE, Contextual Chunk Header, and Document Augmentation.

- HyPE (Hypothetical Prompt Embedding) precomputes hypothetical questions for each document chunk at indexing time, enabling retrieval by question-to-question matching, which improves semantic alignment and retrieval accuracy without adding query-time latency.

- Contextual Chunk Header adds relevant contextual information such as document titles or section headings to each chunk before embedding, helping retrieval models understand and rank chunks better when chunk text alone is ambiguous.

- Document Augmentation enhances chunks by including additional metadata and enhances retrieval quality.

## 📌 Q32: What are the pros and cons of chunk enhancement techniques in RAG?

### ✅ Answer 

Chunk enhancement techniques in RAG, such as HyPE, Contextual Chunk Header, and Document Augmentation, improve retrieval accuracy by enhancing semantic alignment, preserving context, and bridging query-document chunk gaps, leading to better generation performance. 

HyPE boosts relevance through precomputed question embeddings without query-time latency, Contextual Chunk Header clarifies ambiguous chunks with document or section titles, and Document Augmentation enriches chunks with additional metadata. 

However, these methods increase indexing complexity and storage requirements, potentially raising computational costs. Balancing enhanced retrieval quality with resource demands is a key consideration.


## 📌 Q33: Explain how the contextual chunk header technique enhances RAG retrieval.

### ✅ Answer

The Contextual Chunk Header technique in RAG enhances retrieval by adding  document titles, section headings, or summaries to each chunk before embedding, providing critical context that clarifies ambiguous or isolated chunk content.  

This additional information helps the retrieval model better understand the chunk’s relevance to a query, improving semantic alignment and ranking accuracy.
