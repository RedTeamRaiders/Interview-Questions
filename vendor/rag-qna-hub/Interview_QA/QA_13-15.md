## 📌 Q13: How do you choose the chunk size for a RAG system?

### ✅ Answer

Choosing the chunk size for a RAG system involves balancing granularity, context completeness, and computational efficiency. Smaller chunks (e.g., 100-200 tokens) allow precise retrieval but may lack sufficient context. Larger chunks (e.g., 500-1000 tokens) provide more context at the cost of increased computational load and potential noise. 

The optimal size depends on the use case, document structure, embedding model, and the generator (LLM) model. For example, smaller chunks are suitable for fact-based queries, and more complex queries benefit from larger ones.

## 📌 Q14: What are the potential consequences of having chunks that are too large versus chunks that are too small?

### ✅ Answer

Large chunks often mix different topics into one chunk and reduce the chunk's relevance. This can lead to coarse vector representations and less accurate retrieval. Large chunks can also add noise and confuse the model with irrelevant information that isn't important, resulting in a less accurate answer.

Small chunk sizes in RAG systems can lead to fragmented context. This fragmentation often leads to poor retrieval quality because information that is semantically related may be split up into chunks that are not retrieved together. Furthermore, smaller chunks mean that there are more chunks in the vector database, which increases storage costs and slows down the similarity search.

## 📌 Q15: Explain the retrieval process step-by-step in a RAG pipeline.

### ✅ Answer

The retrieval process in RAG systems starts by encoding the user query, i.e., converting it into a dense vector representation using an embedding model.  This vector representation is then used to search the vector database, which has the embeddings of chunks.  

Based on the similarity scores, the vector database system returns the most relevant document chunks.
