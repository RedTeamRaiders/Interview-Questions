## 📌 Q94: Explain why Context Relevancy is considered a "reference-free" metric while Context Precision and Context Recall are "reference-dependent." When would you prefer using Context Relevancy over the other two metrics?

### ✅ Answer

Context Relevancy is considered a "reference-free" metric because it evaluates how relevant the retrieved context is to the user’s query without needing a reference answer. It measures the proportion of statements in the retrieved context that are relevant to the query. 

In contrast, Context Precision and Context Recall are "reference-dependent" as they require a reference answer to determine relevance and completeness of retrieval. 

Context Relevancy is preferred when reference answers are unavailable. The Context Relevancy metric offers a way to assess retrieval quality based solely on the query and retrieved context itself. This is useful for real-time scenarios where ground truth may not exist.

## 📌 Q95: Describe a scenario where a RAG retriever achieves high Context Relevancy but low Context Precision. What does this imply about the retriever’s performance?

### ✅ Answer

A RAG retriever achieves high Context Relevancy but low Context Precision when it retrieves a context where most statements are relevant to the user’s query, but the relevant chunks are ranked lower in the retrieved list, overshadowed by irrelevant ones. 

For example, if a query about "machine learning algorithms" retrieves a context with many relevant statements but places them after less relevant or noisy chunks, Context Relevancy is high (most statements are query-related), but Context Precision@K is low due to poor ranking of relevant chunks. 

This implies the retriever is effective at fetching relevant content but struggles to prioritize relevant chunks over irrelevant ones. 

## 📌 Q96: Suppose a RAG retriever retrieves all relevant chunks but includes many irrelevant ones, leading to low Context Relevancy. How would you improve the retriever to address this issue?

### ✅ Answer

A RAG retriever retrieving all relevant chunks along with many irrelevant ones results in low context relevancy scores. This can be addressed by improving the retriever by refining its filtering and ranking mechanisms. Techniques such as enhancing embedding model quality, applying stricter similarity thresholds, or integrating a re-ranking model can help prioritize highly relevant chunks and suppress noise. 

Additionally, improving the chunking strategy to create more precise and semantically coherent chunks can reduce irrelevant retrievals. These optimizations ensure retrieved context is both comprehensive and focused on the most relevant information.
