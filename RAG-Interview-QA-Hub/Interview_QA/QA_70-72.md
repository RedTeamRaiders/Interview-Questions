## 📌 Q70: Compare the noise reduction capabilities of re-rankers versus simply increasing the similarity threshold in initial retrieval. When would each approach be more appropriate?

### ✅ Answer

Increasing the similarity threshold in initial retrieval reduces noise by filtering out less similar chunks but risks missing relevant ones due to embedding limitations.  Re-rankers reduce noise by prioritizing relevant chunks by deeply understanding query-chunk relevance.

The choice depends on the trade-off between computational cost and precision requirements. Re-rankers are preferred for high-stakes applications like legal or medical searches.  Increasing the similarity threshold is simpler and faster, suitable for resource-constrained environments.

## 📌 Q71: What challenges do re-rankers face regarding computational overhead and latency? 

### ✅ Answer

Re-rankers in RAG systems face significant challenges related to increased computational overhead and latency, as each query-chunk pair must be processed.  

This latency increase can hinder high-throughput environments, making re-rankers computationally expensive compared to initial vector searches and limiting scalability.


## 📌 Q72: In real-time applications with strict latency requirements, describe two specific optimization strategies you could implement to reduce re-ranking overhead while preserving most of the quality gains.

### ✅ Answer

Two effective strategies to reduce re-ranking overhead while preserving quality gains in real-time RAG applications are 

1) Query classifier: Deploy a query classifier to identify complex or analytical queries, invoking the re-ranker only for these while bypassing it for simple factual queries. 

2) Model distillation: Train a smaller, faster re-ranking model to mimic the behavior of a larger, more accurate model, enabling quicker inference with minimal quality loss. 

These approaches balance latency and quality by minimizing computational load without significantly compromising the relevance of retrieved results.
