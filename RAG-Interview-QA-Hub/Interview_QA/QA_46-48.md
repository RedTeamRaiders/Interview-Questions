## 📌 Q46: Explain the role of ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) search algorithms in RAG retrieval.

### ✅ Answer

Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search algorithms play a crucial role in RAG retrieval by enabling fast and scalable search of relevant document chunks within large vector databases.  Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms enable fast search in RAG retrieval by quickly narrowing down the search space to a small subset of candidate vectors instead of scanning all vectors. 

This reduces the number of comparisons needed, significantly speeding up retrieval while maintaining good enough accuracy for relevant document chunks matching. This balance of speed and precision is crucial for real-time and large-scale RAG systems.

## 📌 Q47: Explain the step-by-step working of ANN algorithms for fast search in RAG retrieval.

### ✅ Answer

ANN algorithms for fast search in RAG retrieval involve four steps namely - Encoding, Indexing, Navigating, Retrieving. 

(i) Encoding: Convert document chunks and queries into vector representations.

(ii) Indexing: Organize these vectors into a specialized data structure (like graphs or hash tables) for quick lookup.

(iii) Navigating: Efficiently explore the index to find vectors close to the query without checking all data points. 

(iv) Retrieving: Return the closest approximate neighbors that provide relevant information for RAG retrieval. 

This approach balances search speed and accuracy, enabling fast retrieval in large-scale RAG systems. 


## 📌 Q48: What are the typical distance metrics used for similarity search in vector databases, and why are they chosen?


### ✅ Answer

Typical distance metrics used in vector databases for similarity search are Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and dot product similarity. Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between vectors, making it intuitive for geometric closeness. Cosine similarity evaluates the angle between vectors, focusing on their direction (meaning) rather than magnitude. 

Dot product similarity considers both magnitude and direction. These metrics are selected based on the data type and the underlying embedding model to ensure effective and accurate retrieval.
