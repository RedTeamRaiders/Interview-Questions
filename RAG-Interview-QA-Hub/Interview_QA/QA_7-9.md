## 📌 Q7:  Why is re-ranking important in the RAG pipeline after initial document retrieval?

### ✅ Answer

The top K chunks fetched by the RAG retriever may have irrelevant chunks ahead of relevant ones. Passing these results directly to the LLM hurts the quality of the answers because LLMs mostly look at the top-ranked chunks that are given as context. 

Re-ranking uses cross-encoder models to deeply measure the semantic relevance of  query-chunk pairs and then brings relevant chunks ahead of irrelevant chunks. This reduces the noise and helps the generator LLM to generate more accurate and coherent answers. 

## 📌 Q8: What is the purpose of overlap during chunking in a RAG pipeline?

### ✅ Answer

In a RAG pipeline, chunk overlap during chunking ensures contextual continuity and prevents loss of information at the boundaries of chunks. This improves the retrieval accuracy and maintains coherence in the text fed to the LLM. 

Typically, an overlap of about 10-20% of the chunk size is used to strike a balance between preserving context and computational efficiency in RAG applications.


## 📌 Q9: What role does cosine similarity play in relevant chunk retrieval within a RAG pipeline?

### ✅ Answer

Cosine similarity measures how similar the query embedding is to the embeddings of chunks in the vector database. It finds the cosine of the angle between two vectors and provides a score that shows how closely related the query is to each chunk. Higher scores mean that the chunk is more relevant. 

This enables the RAG system to retrieve the most relevant chunks for the query, which is then used by the generator LLM to generate accurate answers.
