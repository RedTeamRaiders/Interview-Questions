## 📌 Q55: How can fine-tuning embedding models improve the retriever’s performance in RAG?

### ✅ Answer

General embedding models in RAG systems are trained on broad and diverse datasets that capture wide-ranging language patterns. However, they often lack depth in vocabulary and context specific to domains.

Fine-tuning embedding models aligns the embedding space more closely with domain-specific language and context. This allows the embedding model to better represent domain-specific terminology and jargon, which results in more precise and relevant retrieval. 

## 📌 Q56: Design a retrieval strategy for a RAG system that needs to handle both structured data (knowledge graphs) and unstructured data (text documents) simultaneously.

### ✅ Answer

A retrieval strategy for a RAG system handling both structured (knowledge graphs) and unstructured data (text documents) involves a hybrid approach combining vector-based semantic search with graph-based retrieval techniques. 

The system first indexes unstructured text document chunks using vector embeddings for semantic similarity search, while structured data from knowledge graphs is queried using graph traversal methods that leverage explicit entity relationships and schema metadata. 

The results from both sources are then fused to ensure factual precision from structured data and contextual richness from unstructured text. This combined approach enhances completeness and reduces hallucinations in generated responses.


## 📌 Q57:  Tell me the strategies to scale embeddings in RAG retrieval.

### ✅ Answer

To scale embeddings in RAG retrieval, strategies like Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and quantization are highly effective.

MRL enables flexible embeddings by training a single model to produce nested representations of varying sizes, allowing truncation to smaller dimensions (e.g., 64 or 128) with minimal performance loss, achieving up to 14x size reduction and significant retrieval speed-ups. 

Quantization reduces memory usage by compressing embeddings into lower-bit formats like float8 or int8. Combining MRL with quantization can yield up to 8x compression, optimizing storage and retrieval efficiency while maintaining high accuracy for large-scale RAG systems.
