## 📌 Q28: Explain how the HyPE technique works in RAG.

### ✅ Answer

The HyPE (Hypothetical Prompt Embedding) technique improves retrieval accuracy by addressing the semantic mismatch between user queries and document chunks. 

Unlike HyDE, which generates hypothetical answer documents at query time, HyPE precomputes hypothetical questions for each document chunk during the indexing phase. These questions are designed to capture the key concepts in the chunk, transforming retrieval into a "question-to-question" matching process, which reduces latency and improves retrieval.

## 📌 Q29: Compare HyPE and HyDE techniques in RAG.

### ✅ Answer

HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding) and HyPE (Hypothetical Prompt Embedding) enhance RAG by addressing the semantic gap between user queries and document chunks, but they differ in approach.

- Timing: HyPE generates hypothetical questions during indexing, while HyDE generates hypothetical answer documents at query time.

- Efficiency: HyPE reduces runtime latency by avoiding LLM calls during retrieval, unlike HyDE, which requires an LLM call per query.

- Focus: HyPE focuses on question-question matching, while HyDE focuses on answer-answer matching.

While HyDE is flexible for diverse queries, HyPE’s pre-indexed approach is more efficient for real-time applications.

## 📌 Q30: To minimize RAG system latency, which pre-retrieval enhancement technique will you choose?

### ✅ Answer

To minimize RAG system latency, I would choose the HyPE (Hypothetical Prompt Embedding) technique. Unlike query transformation techniques such as query rewriting, query expansion, query decomposition, or HyDE, which require LLM calls at query time and increase latency, HyPE precomputes hypothetical questions for document chunks during the indexing phase. 

This question-to-question matching approach reduces runtime latency by avoiding real-time LLM calls, making it more efficient for real-time applications while maintaining high retrieval accuracy. By shifting the computational effort to indexing, HyPE ensures faster and more precise document retrieval.
