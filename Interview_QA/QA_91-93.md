## 📌 Q91: Describe a scenario where a RAG system might achieve high Context Recall but still produce poor answers. What complementary metrics would you use alongside Context Recall to get a complete picture of retriever performance?

### ✅ Answer

A RAG system might achieve high Context Recall by retrieving most or all relevant information pieces but still produce poor answers if the retrieved context contains noisy or irrelevant data that confuses the generator. 

To get a complete picture of retriever performance, complementary metrics like Context Precision should be used alongside Context Recall. Context Recall along with Context Precision  ensures retrieved content is not only comprehensive but is also relevant and well-ranked.

## 📌 Q92: If your RAG retriever consistently shows Context Recall scores below 0.6, what are the three potential root causes?

### ✅ Answer

Context Recall scores below 0.6 mean that the retriever is missing a significant portion of the relevant information required to answer user queries. 

The three potential root causes are 
(1) an incomplete or outdated knowledge base lacking necessary information, 
(2) ineffective embedding model or ranking algorithms causing semantically relevant chunks to be missed, and 
(3) poor chunking strategy leading to loss of key information. 

## 📌 Q93: Why is it important for RAG systems to optimize both context precision and context recall simultaneously? What trade-offs might occur?

### ✅ Answer

It is important for RAG systems to optimize both context precision and context recall simultaneously. This is because context precision ensures that the retrieved information is highly relevant and ranked appropriately. The Context Recall metric ensures that all necessary information is included in the retrieved context so that the generator can output a complete answer. 

The trade-off often arises because increasing recall by retrieving more chunks may introduce irrelevant chunks, lowering precision. At the same time, focusing solely on precision might omit important information, leading to incomplete responses. 

Balancing these metrics helps create a RAG system that retrieves relevant content efficiently while covering the query comprehensively, resulting in accurate and thorough generated answers.
