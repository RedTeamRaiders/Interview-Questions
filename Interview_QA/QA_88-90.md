## 📌 Q88: In a RAG pipeline, how might context recall impact the completeness of generated answers? Describe a scenario illustrating this relationship.

### ✅ Answer

Context Recall in a RAG pipeline directly impacts the completeness of generated answers by measuring how well the retriever gathers all relevant pieces of information required to answer the user query.

For instance, if a question about a historical event requires multiple claims or facts, a low Context Recall score indicates that some key facts were missed in the retrieved context, leading to incomplete answers. 

A high Context Recall ensures the generator (LLM) has access to all necessary information to produce a complete and well-informed response. 

## 📌 Q89: If your retriever achieves high context precision but low context recall, what types of user queries would likely suffer most?
 
### ✅ Answer

If a retriever in a RAG pipeline achieves high context precision but low context recall, user queries that require multiple distinct pieces of information or comprehensive coverage are likely to suffer most. 

Queries, like complex multi-fact questions or those needing extensive context to answer fully, will suffer because despite the retrieved chunks being relevant (high precision), many essential relevant chunks are missing overall (low recall). 

This results in incomplete answers, as important claims or facts are absent, limiting the model’s ability to generate a thorough response. 

## 📌 Q90: In what situations would you prioritize Context Precision over Context Recall in a RAG retriever, and how would this impact the generator’s performance?

### ✅ Answer

In situations where precision is critical, such as in high-risk domains like healthcare, finance, or legal applications, prioritizing Context Precision over Context Recall in a RAG retriever is essential. This ensures that only the most relevant and trustworthy information is retrieved, minimizing the risk of including irrelevant or misleading content that could negatively impact the generator's response. 

While this may limit the breadth of information (lower recall), it improves the quality and reliability of the generated answers by reducing noise.
