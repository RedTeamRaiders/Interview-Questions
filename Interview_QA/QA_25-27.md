## 📌 Q25: What are the different query transformation techniques that enhance user queries in RAG?

### ✅ Answer

Different query transformation techniques in RAG include query rewriting, query expansion, query decomposition, and HyDE to enhance retrieval relevance and context precision. 

- Query Rewriting: Rewrites the initial user query to make it more specific and detailed, boosting retrieval accuracy.

- Query Expansion using Step-Back Prompting: Generates a broader, generalized version of the query.

- Query Decomposition: Divides complex queries into simpler sub-queries to ensure comprehensive coverage and more precise retrieval for each component question.

- HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding): Synthesizes a hypothetical answer to the query and uses it as a retrieval query to get more relevant document chunks.

## 📌 Q26: What are the pros and cons of query transformation techniques?

### ✅ Answer

Query transformation techniques in RAG systems offer significant advantages, such as improved retrieval accuracy leading to more relevant and contextually accurate responses. 

However, their downsides include increased computational cost, added latency, and potential noise from overexpansion. Over expansion risks retrieving noisy or off-topic documents, while complex methods like query decomposition require careful handling to ensure subqueries align with the original intent. 

Some strategies may also require substantial prompt engineering and continuous optimization to match diverse query scenarios. Balancing effectiveness and efficiency is critical to avoid diminishing returns.

## 📌 Q27: Explain how the HyDE query transformation technique works.

### ✅ Answer

The HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding) technique improves RAG retrieval by transforming the user query into a hypothetical answer before embedding it. Rather than directly searching with the query embedding, the HyDE technique utilizes a large language model (LLM) to create a brief, plausible document that could potentially answer the query. 

This synthetic document is then encoded into an embedding and used for retrieval, leading to better semantic alignment with actual document chunks in the database. As a result, HyDE enhances retrieval quality, especially for vague or underspecified queries.
