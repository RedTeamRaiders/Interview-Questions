## 📌 Q61: How does re-ranking differ from the initial retrieval process in RAG?

### ✅ Answer

The initial retrieval process typically uses a bi-encoder that encodes queries and documents independently and then fetches a broad set of candidates quickly. 

The re-ranking process reorders the retrieval results by taking the query and each retrieved document chunk as a single combined input, scoring their relevance through deep interaction. This improves the final ranking quality at the cost of higher computational overhead

This two-stage approach balances efficiency and accuracy by separating fast, broad retrieval from slower, more exact reranking.

## 📌 Q62: Explain the pros and cons of using re-rankers in RAG.

### ✅ Answer

Re-rankers reorder search results by taking the query and each retrieved document chunk as a single combined input, scoring their relevance through deep interaction within one model pass. This helps to prioritize the most relevant information in the limited context windows in LLMs.

However, re-rankers introduce increased latency and higher computational costs since they perform deep, query-chunk interaction at query time, making them less suitable for real-time or high-traffic applications.

The trade-off between enhanced precision and increased costs makes re-rankers ideal for specialized use cases but less suitable for applications prioritizing speed and cost-efficiency.

## 📌 Q63: What are the different types of re-ranker models that can be used in RAG?

### ✅ Answer

The different types of re-ranker models used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are

- Cross-Encoder Rerankers: These models jointly encode the query and document chunk pair to produce a highly accurate relevance score, offering nuanced understanding of relationships but with medium computational cost.

- Multi-Vector or Late Interaction Models: Such as ColBERT, they encode queries and document chunks separately but perform fine-grained interaction later, balancing efficiency and performance with lower cost.

- Large Language Model (LLM) Rerankers: Utilize powerful LLMs to reason about query-document chunk relevance, achieving great accuracy but incurring high computational overhead.

These models vary in their performance and computational cost, and choice depends on the application's accuracy and latency requirements.
