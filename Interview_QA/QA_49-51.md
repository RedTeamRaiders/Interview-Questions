## 📌 Q49: Explain why cosine similarity is preferred over other distance metrics in RAG retrieval.

### ✅ Answer

Cosine similarity is preferred in RAG retrieval because it measures the angle between vectors, focusing on their direction (meaning) rather than magnitude. This makes it effective for textual data where the meaning lies more in the direction of the embedding than its length. 

Unlike Euclidean distance or dot product, cosine similarity is invariant to vector length, providing stable and interpretable similarity scores. This helps RAG systems retrieve relevant document chunks even when text lengths vary, improving accuracy and consistency in semantic search.


## 📌 Q50: Compare keyword-based retrieval and semantic retrieval in RAG systems.

### ✅ Answer

Keyword-based retrieval in RAG systems relies on the exact or partial matching of keywords in a query to fetch relevant document chunks. This  offers high precision for queries with specific terms but may miss semantically related information. In contrast, semantic retrieval uses embeddings to understand the meaning behind the query and retrieves conceptually relevant content even when keywords differ.

Combining both methods can balance precision and semantic understanding for effective retrieval in RAG systems.


## 📌 Q51:  How does hybrid search work in the context of RAG retrieval?

### ✅ Answer

Hybrid search in RAG systems combines keyword-based retrieval and semantic vector search to leverage the strengths of both methods. It uses a weighted formula to balance keyword relevance and semantic similarity scores. 

This allows precise matching on exact terms while also capturing conceptually related content.
