## 📌 Q43: What are embeddings, and how are they utilized in RAG retrieval?

### ✅ Answer

Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text that capture the semantic meaning and relationships of the data in a high-dimensional space. In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), embeddings are used to convert both the user query and document chunks into vectors, enabling semantic search by comparing these vectors for similarity. 

This process allows RAG systems to retrieve the most relevant and contextually appropriate document chunks from a knowledge base, which are then used as context to generate accurate and grounded responses. Thus, embeddings form the backbone of RAG retrieval by enabling efficient, meaning-driven retrieval beyond simple keyword matching.


## 📌 Q44: What are the key considerations when choosing an embedding model for a RAG system?

### ✅ Answer

When choosing an embedding model for a RAG system, key considerations include 

(i) the model's domain relevance to ensure it accurately captures domain-specific semantics,

(ii) embedding dimensionality, which balances retrieval precision against computational and storage costs, and 

(ii) embedding model performance on the specific dataset to ensure good retrieval quality. This is necessary, as the real-world data often differ from academic datasets. 

(iv) Additionally, factors such as embedding model size, API availability, latency, cost implications, and licensing should be considered to align with infrastructure constraints and use case requirements. 

Choosing the right embedding model directly impacts the effectiveness and scalability of the RAG system.


## 📌 Q45: What is a VectorDB, and how is it utilized in RAG retrieval?

### ✅ Answer

A vector database, or VectorDB for short, is a specialized database designed to store and retrieve high-dimensional vector embeddings. In RAG retrieval, VectorDB is utilized to efficiently perform semantic searches by matching the vector representation of a user query with the closest vectors stored in the database, thereby retrieving the most contextually relevant document chunks. 

VectorDBs enable scalable and fast similarity search, which is crucial for the RAG systems.
