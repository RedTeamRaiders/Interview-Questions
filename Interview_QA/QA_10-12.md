## 📌 Q10: Can you give examples of real-world applications where RAG systems have demonstrated value?

### ✅ Answer

AI search engines are a great example of how RAG systems have changed the way people find information online. AI search engines give you accurate, relevant answers by combining information retrieval with generative AI. 

For instance, RAG-based AI search platforms like Perplexity AI improve the user experience by fetching the most recent and relevant information from large knowledge bases and then giving it back in the format that the user wants.


## 📌 Q11: Explain the steps in the indexing process in a RAG pipeline.

### ✅ Answer

There are four steps in the indexing process of a RAG pipeline: parsing, chunking, encoding, and storing. The parsing step deals with extracting the document content. Then, the chunking step splits the extracted content into smaller pieces called chunks. 

The encoding step uses an embedding model to convert chunks into dense numerical vectors called embeddings. Finally, these embeddings are saved in a vector database for efficient search and retrieval.

All these steps in the indexing process are performed offline.

## 📌 Q12: Explain the importance of chunking in RAG.

### ✅ Answer

Chunking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is crucial because it breaks down large texts into smaller and semantically coherent segments called chunks. Proper chunking helps to find relevant information efficiently by creating focused chunks that maintain context and avoid irrelevant noise. 

Choosing the right chunk size balances detail and context, optimizing both retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency. Ineffective chunking can lead to poor retrieval results and incoherent responses, which makes it a foundational step for successful RAG performance in real-world applications.
