## 📌 Q64: Compare general re-rankers and instruction-following re-rankers in RAG.

### ✅ Answer

General re-rankers in RAG systems primarily focus on re-ranking retrieved document chunks just based on their semantic relevance to the user query. 

In contrast, instruction-following re-rankers go a step further by dynamically adjusting rankings based on additional user-provided instructions such as document recency, source reliability, or metadata criteria. 

## 📌 Q65: Why is the cross-encoder typically used as the re-ranker rather than the bi-encoder?

### ✅ Answer

The cross-encoder is typically used as the re-ranker rather than the bi-encoder because it processes the query and candidate document chunks together, allowing it to capture intricate contextual interactions and provide more accurate relevance scores. 

While bi-encoders encode queries and document chunks separately, enabling fast and scalable retrieval of broad candidate sets, they miss detailed relationships between query-document chunk pairs. 

Cross-encoders, though slower and more resource-intensive, excel in precision, making them well-suited for re-ranking a small set of top candidates identified by the bi-encoder. This combined approach balances scalability with accuracy, leveraging bi-encoders for efficient candidate retrieval and cross-encoders for refined final ranking.

## 📌 Q66: A RAG system retrieves 20 candidate document chunks but can only fit 5 in the LLM's context window. Without re-ranking, how might this limitation affect response quality, and what specific problems would a re-ranker solve?

### ✅ Answer

When a RAG system retrieves 20 candidate document chunks but can only fit 5 in the LLM's context window, the limitation can cause the model to miss critical information from the discarded document chunks. Without re-ranking, the top 5 document chunks may not be the most relevant, leading to incomplete or less accurate answers. 

A re-ranker solves this by analyzing and scoring all retrieved document chunks based on relevance and contextual alignment with the query, ensuring the most relevant chunks are included in the limited window. 

This filtering reduces retrieval noise, enhances coherence, and maximizes the usefulness of the input for the generative model, thereby improving the overall quality of the response.
